# sample-form

This sample application serves as a interview task. I am sending this task through zip package, but the entire codebase is on my private repository. I have even created pipeline for building and testing this project.

## Requirements

The app was build with Node.js 20.x and npm 10.7.x. It should work with older versions as well.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```
